\title{\textbf{Unrolling a Recurrence}}
\author{Remington Greko, Tyler Gutowski, and Spencer Hirsch}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\noindent Work with your team to write a report about the \textit{Master Theorem} for solving
a recurrence.

I've usually avoided the \textit{Master Theorem} because it has too many rules and does not
offer real insight to the solution of the recurrene. However, I do include it in my handouts
and the \textit{Master Therorem} may be useful for find the solution to \textit{Strassen's
matrix multiplication recurrence.}

\[T(n) = 7T(n/2) + O(n^2)\]

\noindent There are many details beneath this recurrecne. I strongly encourage you to read
what is in the Corman textbook and other sources.

Submit the team's report on Canvas. Include a task matric indicating who did what.
